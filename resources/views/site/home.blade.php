                    <p>LManjunath Shanmugam, an IIML alumnus and an IOCL Sales Manager, was murdered on 19th November 2005 at Lakhimpur Khiri, UP as he refused to take bribes and ignored threats to fight adulteration. In his memory the Manjunath Shanmugam Trust (MST), an international corporate community, was created to improve governance in Indian public life. <br>

                        On Manjunath tenth death anniversary, a candle light march was being organized at various B-schools across India in his memory. The playground in Khelgaon hostel of IIM Ranchi was filled with students with candles in their hands and respect in their hearts, for the person who even sacrificed his life to fight evil forces for the country. A one minute silence was observed and National Anthem was sung by the students in his memory. <br>

                        I commit to lead a life of Integrity! This pledge was also taken by the students to honor the values Manjunath stood for. Success Will Come and Go, but Integrity Is Forever. With this thought in mind the students dispersed and promised themselves to abide by the pledge and to carry on the values that righteous man stood for.

                    <p>A blood donation camp was organized at IIM Ranchi hostel premises in collaboration with Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Ranchi. About 114 donors participated with great enthusiasm and approximately, 25.5 l of blood was donated. Post donating blood, the donors were provided with a donor card, certificate of appreciation, a badge from RIMS and refreshments.</p>

                    <p>Funathon and Walkathon were organized for the first time on February 22, 2015 in Morabadi Stadium. The event was received with huge enthusiasm by Ranchi. We saw participation of 250+ people of all ages. Funathon was a running event of 5 km and walkathon was a walking event of 2 km (for the elders).<br>
                        The motto was “to run to show support towards eradication of Human Trafficking, Women’s rights, Child rights and to promote Health & fitness”. Basically, we wanted people to come out of their homes and do something united.<br>
                        With the success of the event, we look forward towards Funathon & Walkathon 2.0 which will be bigger and better.92.7 Big FM, Health freaks, Orchid Medical, Yo- China came forward in support of this event.<br>
                        Prizes were distributed by Mr. Sanjay Mishra of Women & Child development department, Govt. of Jharkhand.

                    <p>Samarpan has initiated “Joy of giving ~ Fulfill Wishes, Gift Smiles”. We seek to fulfill wishes of<br>
                        1) Children at Kshitish School for differently abled children <br>
                        2) The cleaning, security, mess and driving staff at IIM Ranchi hostel<br>
                        We have asked wishes to each student and staff member and came up with two brilliantly decorated wish trees.<br>
                        “Wish Tree for Kshitish“- consisting of wish lists of students of Kshitish school, a school for differently abled (Deaf & Dumb) children<br>
                        “Wish tree Sahayak“- Sahayak means ‘The one who helps’. Thus, this tree has Wish List of those people who ‘help’ us in making our time here at IIM Ranchi a little easy either ‘by cleaning our rooms and toilets’ or ‘by looking after our 24*7 security, irrespective of the weather’ or ‘by preparing our daily meals’, or bridging the gap between college and hostel, i.e., the Housekeeping staff, the Security staff, the Mess staff, the Bus Drivers. <br>
                        The students seek voluntary contributions to help these wish trees grow, to bring a smile to faces of those not as lucky as us, and to celebrate this Diwali with a difference.<br>
                        Away from home, missing family, sweets and pleasantries, the students yet took an effort to bring happiness into the lives of other families by fulfilling their wishes in a humble manner.

                            <p><strong>Accessible India</strong><br>
                                The government launched the “Accessible India Campaign” (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) in the year 2015, which seeks to make at least 50 percent of all government buildings in the national capital and all state capitals “fully accessible” for the differently abled by July 2018. <br>
                                In support of this campaign, Samarpan – the CSR club of IIM Ranchi, organized a case study competition called ‘Samadhan’ on Accessible India, during Agon – The annual Management Fest of IIM Ranchi<br>
                                Since then, we have incorporated this campaign as an integral part of our activities. To highlight their equal place in society, our objective is to help them grow in their life so that they remain independent in their life as far as possible.<br>
                                In order to carry out this campaign, we identified ‘Kshitij School for Deaf & Dumb’ located in Dorando, Ranchi and incorporated with them for workshop and events. The plan is to equip them with latest hearing aids and other technologies so that they remain at par with the common students and make them feel competitive. Other plan includes regular visits of IIM Ranchi students to their campus to introduce them with latest gadgets and interact with them to understand their problem so that the future managers can have better understanding and take initiative to help them.<br>
                                We will be coming up with  many more activities under this campaign. Stay tuned for updates!</p>

                                Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or the Clean India Campaign is a national campaign by the Government of India and it was officially launched on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi.<br>
                                As a part of Swachh Bharat abhiyan, our objective in the campaign is to spread awareness about the cleanliness in the rural as well as urban parts of Ranchi. <br>
                                We will kick start the campaign with Nukkad Natak by the Dramabazz team of IIM Ranchi having the theme of Swachh Bharat abhiyan. The street play would enlighten the people of imbibing the habit of keeping their surroundings clean. Then we would clean the area and distribute dustbins and brooms among the resident of the village to use them on daily basis to promote cleanliness.<br>
                                The Nukkad Natak would end with short speech regarding the importance of maintaining cleanliness and spreading the message to other villages as well.<br>
                                Tentative Date: 17th January, 2016
                                Similar Nukkad Natak will be held at strategic locations in the Ranchi city.<br>
                                We will be coming up with many more activities under this campaign. Stay tuned for updates!

                                The Sanskrit verses in IIM Ranchi’s logo, symbolize the Institute’s vision as working to bring change towards success, not only for one’s self, but also for the community. <br>
                                With this thought, Samarpan club launched the ‘Inclusive Growth’ campaign in the year 2015, with the objective of helping the less fortunate, in their holistic growth and development.<br>
                                From the time of inception of the Samarpan club in 2011, it was always focused on upliftment of the facilities staff working either in the mess, cleaning staff, security guards, etc. at IIM Ranchi. It started with small activities such as donating clothes and stationary, but then it moved on to providing them with a better and sustainable solution to alleviate the conditions of these workers.  We have named the facilities staff of IIM Ranchi as ‘Sahayak’ and we run the inclusive growth campaign for them as our ‘Sahayak – Vikas’ initiative.

                                As part of the inclusive growth campaign, we organise skill development workshops for the women workers of Sahayak group, where they are taught the quilling art. The primary aim of skill development training is to provide them with an additional source of income by selling their products online so as to increase their reach and help them receive maximum value from it. Moreover, many NGOs and self-help groups have initiated to conduct more such types of skill development workshops. <br>
                                We have also launched a ‘Volunteer program – Sahayak Vikas’, wherein the students of IIM Ranchi would volunteer to teach the Sahayak group.  IIM Ranchi student volunteers will help the Sahayak group in their English proficiency, mathematical knowledge, computer training, preparation for competitive exams, etc. Stay tuned for updates!<br>
                                A stall of Sahayak group will be set up during Nirvaadh at the venue, where the products made by the women workers of Sahayak group will be available for sale. Be a part of Nirvaadh and come and support the hard work of these women workers at their booth.
